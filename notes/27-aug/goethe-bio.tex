  \maketitle

  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe - likely the most well-known German 
  author and poet - lived from 1749-1832, inspiring in his life 
  and death the creation of countless musical works, including 
  Franz Liszt's \textit{Mephisto-Walzter}, Hector Berlioz's 
  \textit{Damnation of Faust}, and Hugo Wolf's \textit{Mignon Lieder}
  and [insert the song that is being sung in this recital here].


  
  Anne Steele, for at least a full century after death in 1778 
  was heralded as the most prolific woman represented in English 
  and American Hymnals. Steele was born in 1717 the daugter of 
  an English Baptist Preacher, and, under the pen name \textit{Theodosia}, 
  published more than two hundred hymns, poems, and psalms. Of 
  note is her inclusion in the American Collection 
  \textit{The Sacred Harp}, with her hymn ``So fades the lovely blooming 
  flower" set in the popular tune 32B, Distress.
