  \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
      \item I am familiar with many of the songs discussed and with a decent amount of the poetic analysis concepts introduced.

      \item I was unaware of the ``song style sheets", and while I don't believe they would help me, they seem very useful for a new student, especially one who is less comfortable with their music history and music theory studies.

      \item I wholeheartedly agree with the study of music holistically - that is, both as sound art and in historical and sociological contexts. I'm thus \textit{very} supportive of the ``study sheet" 

      \item I'm not very familiar with all the poets mentioned and the poems mentioned in this chaper: I need to find some of their work and read it, it seems.

      \item I do not currently have any questions.

  \end{enumerate}


  \item These two notes are primarily useful for historical and biographical context. The Hyperion bio's description of Loewe's voice is easily heard in the recording; the wide variety of tones and styles are all very comfortable for a light, acrobatic baritone. I quite enjoy the cute husband-wife moment related by Annika Stawe's programme notes, and while it doesn't add much to the listener's understanding, the little humour is veryimportant for the programme notes, and it will make me remember this song for years to come. 

\end{enumerate}
