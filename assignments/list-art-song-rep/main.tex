\maketitle

I have not \textit{sung} many songs, but I am familiar 
with the accompaniments of many, and I've played a few 
arrangements. I have listed each (in separate) what I've 
\textit{sung} and what I've \textit{played}.



\section*{Songs I've \textit{sung}}
\begin{itemize}

  \item F. Schubert - D.328, \textit{Das Erlkönig}

  \item G. Gershwin - \textit{Summertime} from \textit{Porgy and Bess}

\end{itemize}
