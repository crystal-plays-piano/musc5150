  \maketitle

  This recital started as a loose collection of songs I love,
  then a collection with similar sounds, then
  with similar poems, then slowly morphed into a story, and, as it stands now,
  tells a story of Love, from first sight, to courtship, to sex, to marriage,
  through hardship, death, mourning, and grieving.
