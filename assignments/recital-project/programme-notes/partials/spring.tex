\section*{Spring - Florence Price}

There are promise and pleasure and hope in the spring,\\
That beckon, and reckon the future. I know.\\
The bud and the bee, swaying low on the lea,\\
The dove cooing late.\\
To his nesting mate.\\
In a dream of ecstasy

There are laughter and magic and joy in the spring,\\
That capture, enrapture my heart. I know.\\
A lilt on the breeze, That is tossed by the trees,\\
Which doth for me weave\\
Like a thrush above\\
A song of ecstasy.

Ah! There are madness and gladness and nothing of sadness.\\
That will me and thrill me and fill me I know\\
Life and its weal are to give and to feel\\
The soul that can ache,\\
The heart that can break.\\
With a pain of ecstasy.

Florence Price (1887-1953), remarkably, is both composer and poet for this song,
which is unusual in the realm of Western Classical Song. Her contributions
to the field of poetry, though pleasant, have yet to enter a wider canon; she
does number, in contrast, amongst the most influential and loved Classical
composers. With her monumental First Symphony in E Minor, Price became the
first African-American Woman to have her music performed by a major U.S.
Orchestra in 1933. Her musical style is a distinct blend of her European
training and American upbringing, merging large-scale European structures
with the rhythmic and harmonic richness of African-American spirituals.
