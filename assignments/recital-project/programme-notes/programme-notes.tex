\section*{\textbf{3 Browning Songs} - Amy Beach}

\textbf{The Year's at the Spring}\\

The year’s at the spring,\\
And day’s at the morn;\\
Morning’s at seven;\\
The hill-side’s dew-pearl’d;\\
The lark’s on the wing;\\
The snail’s on the thorn;\\
God’s in His heaven–\\
All’s right with the world!\\

\textbf{Ah, Love, but a day}\\

Ah, Love, but a day,\\
And the world has changed!\\
The sun’s away,\\
And the bird estranged;\\
The wind has dropped,\\
And the sky’s deranged;\\
Summer has stopped.\\

Look in my eyes!\\
Wilt thou change too?\\
Should I fear surprise?\\
Shall I find aught new\\
In the old and dear,\\
In the good and true,\\
With the changing year?\\

Thou art a man,\\
But I am thy love.\\
For the lake, its swan;\\
For the dell, its dove;\\
And for thee — (oh, haste!)\\
Me, to bend above,\\
Me, to hold embraced.\\

\textit{Beach only set the first two stanzas in her song.}

\textbf{I Send My Heart Up To Thee}\\

I send my heart up to thee, all my heart\\
In this my singing,\\
For the stars help me, and the sea, and the sea bears part;\\
The very night is clinging\\
Closer to Venice’ streets to leave on space\\
Above me, whence thy face\\
May light my joyous heart to thee, to thee its dwelling place.\\
