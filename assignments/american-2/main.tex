  \section*{Question 1}
    I chose to focus on the poem ``Spring and Fall",
    by Gerard Manley Hopkins.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
      \item{The somber tone and the specific rhythmic notation
        (with the accents, as I understand they are used in English
        Poetry) are the primary elements that drew me to this
        poem. Also of relevance is the discourse of the interior
        of the child (if, I am, in fact, interpreting this in a
        reasonable way). I, for one, strongly believe in the
        agency of children, so a poem with a child subject
        experiencing and healing from grief is one that pains
        and intrigues me. Oh! poor child.}
      \item{I chose to listen to the songs ``Spring and Fall" and
        ``Margaret", by Ned Rorem and Alec Wilder, respectively.}
      \item{The rhythmic uncertainty that begins Rorem's setting is
        disorienting, but the harmonic content warms and familiarises
        us to the sound. Rorem's setting, as I understand, is
        quite idiomatic for his music. The use of suspended harmonies,
        displaced/disoriented rhythm, and the repeated melodic insistence
        on \(\hat{2}\) - that is, the second scale degree - lends itself
        to a particular sense of nostalgia and frigidity, as well as a
        very text-forward voice. Centering one note melodically
        provides a pitch foundation from which it is easier - for me,
        at least - to gleam the lyric content. In contrast, while I
        do quite love the musical content of the Wilder setting - as
        I love everything I hear of Alec Wilder - I have a difficult
        time discerning the lyric content of the voice. The choice
        of voice range - and thus, though I loathe to relate the two -
        an implicit characterization and \textit{gendering} of the
        narrator colour both settings differently, with Rorem and
        Wilder invoking a sort of Fatherly/Motherly duality. }
      \item{I think,
        as I listen to these settings while working, the Wilder setting
        is more immediately attractive, with its more straightforward
        melodic presentation, but the Rorem setting will remain in my
        heart. The subtlety of piano texture, rhythmic displacement,
        and \textit{very} controlled melodic contour are striking. }

    \end{enumerate}

  \section*{Question 2}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
      \item{If this set is to adequately span Rorem's entire
        body of work, it's quite remarklable that both ``The Lordly
        Hudson" and ``Ferry me across the water" portray the river.
        Of the three, I'm quite struck by the contemporality of
        ``The Sick Wife" - the text is very modern, and points, to me,
        very clearly to the impact of postwar nuclearisation of
        the American Family - i.e. 1970s to 1990s. This focused
        temporality is, to me, unfamiliar in other writing we've
        studied. Musically, I would call none of the three songs
        quick. All of them are pensive and weighty - not dirges -
        without, as I hear, a performance of Grandeur. I am slowly
        but quite warmly growing accustomed to the harmonic language
        of Ned Rorem. }
      \item{It should be quite clear that my favourite of these
        three poems is ``The Sick Wife", by Jane Kenyon. My program note is as follows:
