        \item{rhythmically playful}
        \item{countermelody in piano crossing hands with quicker,

  \section*{Question 2}
    For this Question, I could not find an orchestrated version of
    Hahn's setting, so I compared the Fauré setting for which I could
    find the version with the string quartet.

    Notably, I could not find a score for the string parts of this
    piece, and it seems, as detailled in the liner notes of the
    Columbia Masterworks \textit{Chamber Music from Marlboro} CD,
    that, while the performance with string quartet seems intentional
    by Fauré, the printed score has been lost.
    \subsection*{Piano Accompaniment}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{a very bright arrangement + sound}
        \item{the triplet piano figure could be a reference to Beethoven's
          \textit{Moonlight} Sonata}
        \item{very pianistic}
      \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{With String Quartet}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{due to the instrumentation, \textit{much} warmer}
        \item{countermelodies taken by different instruments}
        \item{very indicative of Fauré's ``stillness" in harmonic contexts}
      \end{itemize}

    Overall, though the piano has my heart, I do prefer to hear the
    version with
    both piano and string quartet. The added warmth, colour, and clarity
    of countermelody are most appreciated. I will admit, however, that
    the quiet intimacy of a simple piano accompaniment is lost in a
    larger ensemble; this is - like the contrast between R. Schumann's
    \textit{Widmung} and the Liszt arrangement - the most important
    deciding factor outside of sound. Is it ``worth it" to lose out on
    the intimacy factor for a warmer sound? I think it is, but only by
    a small margin.

  \section*{Question 3}
    \subsection*{Debussy - 1882 version}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{dramatic, passionate}
        \item{conventional chordal piano texture with lilting rhythm}
        \item{less `muted' than other settings}
      \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{Debussy - Fêtes galantes}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{pentatonic-adjacent melody}
        \item{interesting "rocking" piano texture at
          "Au souffle berceur t doux"}
        \item{never louder than piano}
      \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{Fauré}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{piano counter melody! }
        \item{arpeggiated figuration reminiscent of Mendelssohn}
        \item{LOTS of suspensions used for colour (left unresolved)}
      \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{Hahn}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{hilariously, the piano motive reminds me of Gershwin's
          `Summertime' from Porgy and Bess, which, interestingly
          enough, has a similarly slow/somber tempo and sound (though
          the lyrics wildly differ in tone).}
        \item{beautiful piano counter melod\textbf{ies}.}
        \item{harmonic stability/stillness (the harmony rarely changes)}
      \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{Poldowski}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{HUGE dynamic range}
        \item{each stanza is given a distinct treatment (new textures
          and melodies)}
        \item{reminds me of the first movement of Beethoven Op 101
          or the second movement of Bach's 5th Brandenburg Concerto
          (both movements could, by Shenker, be reduced to a simple,
          though heavily extended, V-I Cadence)}
      \end{itemize}

  \clearpage{}

    \subsection*{Similarities}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{very slow (tempo and rhythmic divisions)}
        \item{slow harmonic movement + unresolved `non-tonal' figures}
        \item{each composer likes to keep the melody on one note
          for a long time (be it repetition or simply meandering
          around a particular note.}
      \end{itemize}
